👋 Hi, I’m @namin-an.   
👀 My vision is to make the world a better place with artificial intelligence.   
🌱 Currently, I am taking Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing and Algorithm courses online in Coursera.   
💞️ I'm collaborating with [ImLab](http://imvisionlab.com/) members at KIST to simulate artificial vision, decode neural signals, and process fluorescence images.      
⭐️ I'm thrilled to join professor [Thorne's lab](https://xfact.net/) at KAIST in the upcoming spring 2023.
