- 👋 Hi, I’m @namin-an.
- 👀 I’m interested in how to make the world a better place with artificial intelligence.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning reinforcement learning, natural language processing and algorithm in Coursera.
- 💞️ I’m collaborating with ImLab members to simulate enhanced version of artificial vision.
- ⭐️ I am thrilled to join professor Thorne's lab at KAIST in the upcoming spring 2023.
