👋 Hi, I’m @namin-an.   
👀 My vision is to make the world a better place with unbiased and interpretable artificial intelligence.   
🌱 I am a graduate student in professor [Thorne's lab](https://xfact.net/) at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).   
💞️ I have previously collaborated with [ImLab](http://imvisionlab.com/) members at Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) to simulate artificial vision, decode neural signals, and process fluorescence images.
